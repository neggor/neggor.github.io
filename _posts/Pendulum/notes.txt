## UPDATE (19-12-2024)

(also ignoring friction in what follows, todo)
So, the thing is that this formulation is not general. This is not considering a linear model in general, but only matrices in SO(2n).
This framework cannot handle other groups such GL(n) because what it is being explicitly model is just a rotation matrix, essentially a torus.

This only works because there exist a linear map between an ellipse and a circle. That allows me to modle then the system in terms of SO(2), but
this might not be the general case!!! 

Now, a cool question, that requires getting much stronger in LA is how would one go to parameterize this eigenvalue in a general way.
TODO: Check if there is a mention of those details in the paper.
TODO: Check the other system they model
TODO: Confirm r is actually a constant (it will surely be)

TODO: But, furthermore, what is here to learn regarding the importance of the symmetries?? Especially how important they are for extrapolation in machine learning.

Because you are also ignoring the fact that the koopman theorem states linear models, not a subset of them... But one may wonder, to which extent could we 
actually try to model stuff using a projection to an space where SO(n) is a good approximation? That would be very nice, but it is kind of stupid hahaha

But ok, despite all the difficulties I think it is actually good that I am making progress with this!

Furthermore!! To which extent DMD is unable to deal with this? Well because the continuous spectra I guess, but that function also does not seem so complicated.
